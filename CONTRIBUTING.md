# How to Contribute

This project is published primarily as a (functional) tech demo. In case the
project turns out to be useful for others, that’s great!

Corrections and improvements to documentation are welcome. In general,
corrections must pass the existing tests, and any changes which break the
author’s use-case will be reverted.

Please file an issue to get agreement on new features before sending a pull
request. Simplicity is a core tenant of this project, so pull requests might be
declined.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
